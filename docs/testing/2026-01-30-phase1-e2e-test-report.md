# Phase 1 E2E Test Report

**Date:** January 30, 2026
**Framework:** Playwright
**Total Tests:** 116
**Status:** PASSED

## Summary

All Phase 1 E2E tests are passing across the desktop-1920 viewport. The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the ClusterKit, burn-in, firmware/cable validation, lab scenarios, integration workflows, and visual regression testing.

## Test Results by Category

| Category | Tests | Passed | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| ClusterKit Commands | 16 | 16 | PASS |
| Burn-in Tests (NCCL, HPL, NeMo) | 17 | 17 | PASS |
| Firmware & Cable Validation | 24 | 24 | PASS |
| Lab Scenarios (Domain 4) | 21 | 21 | PASS |
| Integration Workflows | 19 | 19 | PASS |
| Visual Regression | 19 | 19 | PASS |
| **Total** | **116** | **116** | **PASS** |

## Coverage Areas

### ClusterKit Commands
- Basic `clusterkit assess` execution
- Verbose mode (`--verbose`)
- Node targeting (`--node dgx-01`)
- Error handling for invalid commands
- Help text display
- Responsive behavior across viewports

### Burn-in Tests
- NCCL burn-in with custom iterations
- HPL burn-in with problem size configuration
- NeMo burn-in with model selection
- Performance metrics validation
- Error handling for invalid inputs

### Firmware & Cable Validation
- ipmitool BMC info and FRU display
- nvidia-smi power/clocks/temperature info
- mlxcables cable health reporting
- ibdiagnet signal quality metrics
- ibstat port state verification

### Lab Scenarios (Domain 4)
- Navigation to labs section
- Domain card display and selection
- Lab workspace UI elements
- Command execution within labs
- Hints system functionality
- Lab exit and progress tracking
- Responsive panel behavior
- Multi-domain lab support
- Practice exam access

### Integration Workflows
- Full production validation workflow
- Cross-tool correlation (ClusterKit + nvidia-smi)
- Sequential command execution
- Performance under rapid command execution
- Error recovery after invalid commands
- Node switching with SSH
- Terminal clear and reset

### Visual Regression
- Welcome screen across 3 viewports (1920, 1366, 2560)
- Simulator terminal snapshots
- ClusterKit output visual validation
- Labs page layout
- Lab workspace layout
- Dark theme consistency

## Test Infrastructure

### Viewport Configuration
- **Desktop 1920:** 1920x1080 (primary)
- **Laptop 1366:** 1366x768
- **Large Display 2560:** 2560x1440

### Test Helpers
The `SimulatorTestHelper` class provides:
- Navigation methods (`navigateToSimulator`, `navigateToLabs`)
- Command typing (`typeCommand`)
- Output verification (`waitForCommandOutput`, `verifyOutputContains`)
- Terminal output retrieval (`getTerminalOutput`)

### Data-testid Attributes Added
- `welcome-screen` - Welcome page container
- `terminal` - Terminal component
- `lab-workspace` - Lab workspace panel
- `nav-labs` - Labs navigation button
- `labs-list` - Labs list container
- `domain-1-card` through `domain-5-card` - Domain cards
- `practice-exam-card` - Practice exam card

## Known Limitations

1. **Dynamic Content:** Some visual regression tests may show minor pixel differences due to:
   - Timestamp variations
   - Temperature value fluctuations
   - Random performance metrics

2. **Terminal Output Scrolling:** Very long command outputs may only capture the visible portion

## Recommendations

1. Consider adding screenshot masking for dynamic timestamp areas
2. Implement test data fixtures for consistent simulator state
3. Add cross-browser testing (Firefox, WebKit)
4. Consider adding accessibility (a11y) testing

## CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions workflow configured at `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`:
- Runs on push to main branch
- Runs on pull requests
- Uploads test artifacts on failure
- Uses Playwright's official GitHub Action

## Next Steps

1. Generate baselines for other viewports (laptop-1366, large-2560)
2. Add mobile viewport testing if needed
3. Integrate with main CI pipeline
4. Add performance benchmarking for test execution time
